I look at it sometimes and realize how portable and small it is, but IT FEELS AS BIG AS LIKE A TV SCREEN. It's not a huge computer, but when your doing work and typing or whatever watching youtube it feels like a movie screen, beautiful. I never had such a good computer that just feels like a breath of fresh air. If you are contemplating on buying one, I would get 512 GB of storage and 16 ram. You will not be disappointed if you buy this no matter what, I strongly recommend it.",
